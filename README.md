# c_practice
- my 'C' language practices

# VS Code commands
 - [shift+option+f]  to format code

 # Pointers work with addresses only
 - pointers literals are addresses only
 - &someVariable - by ampersant we get address of a var

 - NULL is only for pointers
 - struct cannot be null. It already allocates data
- struct node *temp; it is a pointer to a struct which means adress of a struct alocated memory
